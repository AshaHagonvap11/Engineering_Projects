I will post part files and code related to projects I make. You can view videos of the projects here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg4giik_ysj2Td49WL-DQ1g

All files posted here are provided "as is". If you have any questions during the build, reach out to me and I'll do my best to help.

You are free to use and modify all content posted here.

Please let me know if you build one of my projects! I would love to see a photo of it.
