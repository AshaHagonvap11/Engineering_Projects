SCARA BOM for items not included in the SolidWorks assembly file:

4x 200mm loops of 6mm wide GT2 timing belt
Around 1.5m of GT2 timing belt for the Z-axis. 
1x 400mm loop of GT2 timing belt for the final 5:1 arm segment

15x 608 ball bearings

1x Arduino Uno and CNC Shield V3.0

1x 5v Breadboard PSU to power the MG996 servo

4x A4988 stepper drivers (Or equivalent)

Braided cable sleeving for cable management

4x Limit Switches

Note: The D-profile shafts that are used as the gearbox output shafts will need to be made from 8mm round bar.
I used an angle grinder to remove the bulk of the material, and then finished it off by draw-filing while 
frequently checking the dimension with calipers. If you have access to a mill, that would make it easier.
You want to remove 1mm from one side to create the flat (So for the 8mm rods, it should measure 7mm on the flat).

I wish I knew of a good source to buy D-profile shaft, but I was not able to find any. Luckily it's not too hard to make.
